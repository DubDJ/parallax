## Parallax Template

![Parallax Screens]
(http://hassancorrigan.com/img/project-img-5.png)

A simplistic way to implement a parallax scroll web page, with no javascript or browser hacks required.

## Motivation

Simplifying the sometimes badly implemented idea of parallax scroll. Some of these implementations can lead to browser bugs and a bad user experience. Using simple fixed backgrounds can make the design a lot faster and easier on browsers.

## Setup

Add your own images and customise the design of the webpage. No other setup required.
